<h2 class="center"><em>Create authentic C64 SID music on the go!</em></h2>

GTMobile is an Android application designed for musicians and enthusiasts to create authentic Commodore 64 SID music on the go.
It is based on and (mostly) compatible with the original [GoatTracker 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goattracker2/),
providing a familiar experience for users accustomed to that platform.

GTMobile is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPLv2).

Get the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twobit.gtmobile).
If you enjoy using GTMobile and would like to support its development, consider [buying me a pizza](https://buymeacoffee.com/twobit)!
