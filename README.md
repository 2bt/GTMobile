*Create authentic C64 SID music on the go!*

GTMobile is an Android app for creating C64 SID music.

Based on the original [GoatTracker 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/goattracker2/) by Lasse Öörni,
using the reSID SID emulation by Dag Lem.

The app is already usable but not quite finished yet. If you don't want to wait,
grab the [Debug APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_LMvW3vUbYGw5DYRs7wx34yW9SLj_k5/view?usp=drive_link) or
